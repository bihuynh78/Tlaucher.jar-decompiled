crash.run.version=You have an error due to the small size of the paging file or due to the large number of running applications, turn off all applications. TLAUNCHER will set the default RAM size size, it should help. You can increase the size of RAM in the settings yourself, we recommend to increase the size of the paging file. Try to start the game again!
crash.remove._java_options=You need to remove this parameter _java_options, study the material at the link below. <br><a href='https://tlauncher.org/en/java-options-problem.html'>https://tlauncher.org/en/java-options-problem.html</a>

crash.switch.antivirus.system=Try to turn off the antivirus and restart the launcher, if this does not help, you can try to remove the antivirus and check again
crash.switch.antivirus.system.auto=The launcher will start fixing the problem after closing this message (you may need administrator access, in this case, allow the launch from the administrator). <br> Wait 20 seconds and restart the computer, then check if the problem is resolved.
crash.swap.file.increase=You need to fix this problem yourself, for this: <br> 1) Find out how much memory you have allocated for swap. <br> 2) Enter in the Internet search engine 'Change the swap size of computer memory'. <br> 3) If the value of the swap memory 0 or small, then set to 5000 megabytes.
